This program is a Fitness Chatbot that takes parameters from the user to generate in a preconstructed prompt. 
After the preconstructed point is ran, the user will be able to chat with the chatbot incase the user has any further questions.
I implemented this program using OpenAI's api.
In order to run the program you must have an OPENAI_API_KEY from your OPENAI account that has credit in it that can be used. You then have to use the command:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
and repace 'your_api_key_here' with your API_KEY.
